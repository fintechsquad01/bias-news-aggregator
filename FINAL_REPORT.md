# Final Project Report: Bias-Aware U.S. Stock Market News Aggregator

## Executive Summary

This report presents the completed Bias-Aware U.S. Stock Market News Aggregator, a comprehensive web-based platform that aggregates stock market news and analyzes each piece for ideological bias and market sentiment. The system successfully implements all requirements specified in the PRD, providing a powerful tool for investors to understand potential media bias in financial news coverage.

## Project Deliverables

The project includes a complete GitHub-ready codebase with:

1. **Backend API**: A FastAPI-based REST API that handles news aggregation, bias analysis, and sentiment analysis
2. **Frontend Application**: A React-based user interface with interactive visualizations
3. **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL database models for storing news articles and analysis results
4. **Docker Configuration**: Containerized setup for easy deployment
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: README, API documentation, user guide, deployment guide, and more

## Key Features Implemented

### News Aggregation
- Integration with multiple financial data sources (Polygon.io, Finnhub, Financial Datasets API, WhaleWisdom)
- Periodic background fetching of news articles
- Efficient storage and retrieval of news data

### Bias Analysis
- Categorization of news sources on a left-center-right political spectrum
- Bias distribution visualization for individual stocks and portfolios
- Viewpoint diversity warnings when coverage lacks balance

### Sentiment Analysis
- Natural language processing to determine bullish, bearish, or neutral sentiment
- Sentiment distribution visualization for individual stocks and portfolios
- Overall sentiment summary for stocks

### User Interface
- Clean, responsive design using Material UI
- Interactive charts for bias and sentiment visualization
- Ticker-based and portfolio-based news feeds
- Filtering capabilities for news articles

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- FastAPI framework for high-performance API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Alembic for database migrations
- Background task scheduling for news fetching
- Modular service-based architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- React for component-based UI development
- Material UI for consistent design system
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API communication
- Recharts for data visualization

### Infrastructure
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Support for both self-hosted deployment and cloud deployment (Vercel/Supabase)
