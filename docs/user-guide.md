### Ticker Details
- When a ticker is selected, detailed analysis for that stock is displayed
- Similar to the Ticker Page, this includes bias distribution, sentiment distribution, and recent news

## Understanding Bias Analysis

The application categorizes news sources on a political spectrum:

- **Left**: Sources with a strong liberal bias
- **Lean Left**: Sources with a moderate liberal bias
- **Center**: Sources with minimal partisan bias
- **Lean Right**: Sources with a moderate conservative bias
- **Right**: Sources with a strong conservative bias

This categorization is based on AllSides Media Bias Ratings, a widely respected methodology.

### Interpreting Bias Distribution

- A balanced distribution indicates diverse viewpoints in the news coverage
- A skewed distribution (more than 60% from one category) indicates potential bias in the coverage
- When bias is detected, a warning is displayed to help you be aware of the imbalance

## Understanding Sentiment Analysis

The application analyzes the sentiment of news articles:

- **Bullish**: Positive sentiment towards the stock
- **Bearish**: Negative sentiment towards the stock
- **Neutral**: Balanced or factual reporting without strong sentiment

### Interpreting Sentiment Distribution

- A predominantly bullish sentiment may indicate positive market outlook
- A predominantly bearish sentiment may indicate negative market outlook
- A balanced sentiment distribution suggests mixed or neutral market outlook

Remember that sentiment analysis is based on automated processing of text and should be considered as one of many factors in your investment decisions.
